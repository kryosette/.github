# everything will be soon! 
**this social network will only be available as a desktop application on linux !** (most likely on x86)

# i will try to make the first working demo of the social network in 4-5 months.

I've been developing a social network from scratch for a year now. Key principles: security built into the architecture, minimal dependency on third-party services, fault tolerance, and proprietary algorithms.

Implemented Basic Functionality:
• User profile system
• Friend adding mechanism
• Post publishing with comments and polls
• System of public\private chats

Unique Technological Components: (only the base\prototype is done)
• Transcendent bridge (with extension to all levels, not just L2)
• Coolest system of security scanners and detectors
• Proprietary implementation of onion routing
• Comprehensive security system of our own development
• My own in-memory db

In Near Development:
• RPKI validator
• Additional network security tools
• Secure chats (will start with private ones)
• Transparent Editor
etc.
