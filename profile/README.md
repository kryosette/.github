# everything will be soon! 
**this social network will only be available as a desktop application on linux !** (most likely on x86)

# i will try to make the first working demo of the social network in 4-5 months. 

approximately 27.06.2026

# I've been developing a social network from scratch for a year now. 
Key principles: security built into the architecture, minimal dependency on third-party services, fault tolerance, and proprietary algorithms.

```text
Implemented Basic Functionality:
• User profile system
• Friend adding mechanism
• Post publishing with comments and polls
• System of public\private chats

Unique Technological Components: (only the base\prototype is done)
• Transcendent bridge (with extension to all levels, not just L2)
• Coolest system of security scanners and detectors
• Proprietary implementation of onion routing
• Comprehensive security system of our own development
• My own in-memory db

In Near Development:
• RPKI validator
• Additional network security tools
• Secure chats (will start with private ones)
• Transparent Editor
• Translator
• Replication and etc
• Local great analyzer
etc.
```
Almost all the code will be hidden, but you will be able to see almost every process in real time through the translator and change settings through the editor.

> There will be features (and already are) that have never existed or have never been implemented in this way.

Production will only take place when everything is ready.

an approximate list of what should be (not everything is here)
- there is no ICMP (there will be a replacement)
- all traffic and everything else is visible
- almost everything will be stored locally, maybe even everything
- everything is encrypted (checksums will be checked)

also a couple of days ago came up with an incredible idea on how to make an architecture with practically no servers, where almost everything will be stored locally, where in theory you'll be able to change a whole lot (who to show a post to, who to hide it from, and infinitely many other things)
it might also be impossible to block this network
